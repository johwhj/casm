General Syntax
==============

CASM uses C-like general syntax. It supports global variable and function.
Those are machine independent.

Comment
-------

As in C, multi-line comments start and end with mirroring slash-asterisk pairs.

```
/*
These lines
are ignored
by assembler
*/
```

And single line comments starts with two slashes.

```
// This line is ignored by assembler
```

Function
